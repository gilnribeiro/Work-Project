# Work-Project

"This work project presents an argument for, and a prototype of, a system for aggregation of online
job vacancies and their storage. Firstly, an overview of the online job market in Europe highlights
the jobs data advantages for Businesses, Government, and other stakeholders. Next, via an
automated pipeline, data from selected Portuguese job platforms was aggregated and transformed,
leveraging machine learning tools. The collected data was analyzed to visualize the Portuguese
jobs market by jobs, locations, sectors, and skills. We conclude, discussing how stakeholders can
contribute toward the projectâ€™s implementation and reflect on future development. This work
project is part of an ongoing partnership project with the IEFP."

This contains folders from Data Collection, Data Cleaning, to ESCO project and Data Visualization, detailing the code used for each section.

The final thesis work will be available after the Work Project Defense.
