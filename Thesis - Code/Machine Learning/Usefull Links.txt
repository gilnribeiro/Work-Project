Regarding having a classifier that has more data incoming over time:
 - Look up on-line algorithms which learn sequentially from data, point by point

On Retraining or not a model:
(Check answer 1 and answer 2) - Mini bach learning may be what you are looking for

"your model should learn, it should not memorize items. So if you made a good model you don't need to worry about the new items. However, in some cases model may change in time, in these cases, you can relearn the model after a while (with past data those you surely know the answers)."
